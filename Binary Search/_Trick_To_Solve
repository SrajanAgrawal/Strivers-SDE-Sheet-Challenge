Listen Binary Search questions are very straight forward. 

steps to follow:
1) start 
2) end
3) while(start<=end) {
    do operations
}



Trick:
1) IF in the question it is given that the array is sorted then make sure to think about binary search.
2) If you know the range in which your answer can be somewhat like [mn,mx] then make sure to optimize this using binary search.
3) there is a technique like if you are solving the problems then may be you need the value of mid as ans so make sure to store it prior.
for example; 


while(mn<=mx){
    mid = mn + (mx-mn)/2;
    if(check(weights, mid, days)) {
        mx = mid-1;
        ans = mid; // store the answers value.
    }
    else{
        mn = mid+1;
    }
}
return (ans);


4) If you want to find min ka max or max ka min then you can use Binary Search.
